    <h4>Origin</h4>
    <p>This software is based on <a href="https://github.com/gui81/scorekeeper">https://github.com/gui81/scorekeeper</a>, modified for table tennis and simplified.</p>

    <h4>Rankings</h4>
    <p>The calculations for rankings is based on
      the <a href="http://www.bonziniusa.com/foosball/tournament/TournamentRankingSystem.html">Bonzini
        Player Ranking System</a> which is based on the FIDE (international
      chess federation) ranking system. Bonzini has tweaked the FIDE system
      to take into account the specifics of foosball.</p>

    <h4>Ratings Scale and Ranking Classifications</h4>
    <p>The Elo system uses a so-called interval scale, which means that
      the differences in rating is the only factor of significance in
      terms of probabilities. The classification interval is simply the
      rating difference between the top and bottom of a ranking
      classification. In such a ranking classification the poorest player
      on a good day will play at the same level as the best player on an
      off day. Bonzini USA uses a classification interval (Ranking level)
      of 500 points, to make it easy to recognize when a player changes
      ranking classifications (i.e., whenever they cross a multiple of 500
      points threshold, like 1000, 1500, 2000, etc.).</p>

    <dl class="terms">
      <dt>Novice</dt>
      <dd>(0-499 Points): From a
        true beginner (player exposed to foosball for the first time) to
        the player who has developed the basic skills involved in
        foosball.</dd>
      <dt>Novice-Elite</dt>
      <dd>(500-999 Points): Moderately skilled, but lacks the
        level of skills or consistency necessary to be "competitive" in major
        tournament open division events (i.e., against Expert-Elite and Master
        rated players). Note: since it is unlikely a Beginner would enter a
        tournament, most new players entering a tournament for the first time are
        initially rated in this classification.</dd>
      <dt>Expert</dt>
      <dd>(1000-1499 Points): Has the skills to be
        "competitive" in major tournament open division events (i.e., against
        Expert-Eite and Master rated players). Is good by ordinary standards, but
        not likely to win many matches in major tournament open division
        events.</dd>
      <dt>Expert-Elite</dt>
      <dd>(1500-1999 Points): Has the skills to beat
        "anyone" (e.g., Master or Master-Elite rated player) in a given major
        tournament open division match, but not likely to be able to win enough of
        those matches in a row (i.e., beat everyone) to win a major tournament open
        division event.</dd>
      <dt>Master</dt>
      <dd>(2000-2499 Points): Has the skills to beat
        <em>everyone</em> (i.e., win) in a given major tournament open division
        event.</dd>
      <dt>Master-Elite</dt>
      <dd>(2500 Points and above): The most "elite"
        players, expected to win or place highly in any given major tournament open
        division event. (Note: no one is given this ranking as an initial (average)
        rating, it can only be obtained by earning points in major tournament
        events).</dd>
